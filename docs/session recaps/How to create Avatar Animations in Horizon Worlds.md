## 🧩 Download New Avatar Skeleton Rig and fbx2anim.zip File

* Go to the resource link and download both files. [https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/full-bodied-avatars/creating-avatar-animations](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/full-bodied-avatars/creating-avatar-animations)  
    
* Extract the fbx2anim.zip and save to (C:\\bin\\fbx2anim\\fbx2anim.exe)  
    
* Make sure to use the new avatar skeleton I uploaded to the animation channel, then save the **avatar skeleton rig FBX** somewhere easy to find later.

---

## 🕺 Import Avatar Skeleton into Mixamo and Pick an Animation

* Upload the **avatar skeleton FBX** to [Mixamo.com](https://www.mixamo.com).

* Choose a looping animation like a dance or idle motion.

* Adjust the animation settings (e.g., overdrive, arm space, trim start/end).

---

## 📤 Export FBX with Default Settings out of Mixamo

* Click **Download → FBX for Blender (default settings)**.

* Save your exported animation file locally.

---

## 🧱 Import FBX into Blender and Make Animation Adjustments

* Open Blender and import the Mixamo FBX with default settings.

* On the Blender timeline, extend or trim the frame range so the motion loops perfectly.  
    
* Make tweaks and animation adjustments if needed. 

* Test playback and adjust keyframes for smooth transitions.

---

## 🧾 Export Out of Blender (Only Deform Bones, No Leaf Bones)

* Go to **File → Export → FBX**.  
    
* In **Export settings**, enable Selected Objects only. 

* Under **Armature**, disable *Add Leaf Bones* and ensure *Only Deform Bones* are checked before exporting.

---

## **💻 Open Worlds Desktop in Administrator Mode (This step is necessary)**

* Right-click **Horizon Worlds Desktop App**.

* Select **Run as Administrator** for full file import access.

* Confirm system permissions if prompted.

---

### **🌍 Import Animation into Horizon Worlds**

* Inside Worlds, open My Assets \- Add New \- Animation

* Upload your exported Blender animation file.

---

### **🕹️ Add Trigger and Script to Make the Avatar Dance**

* Add a **Trigger Zone** in your world.

* Attach a **Script Gizmo** onto **Trigger Zone** that plays the imported animation. (See script below)

* Test in play mode — your avatar should now dance in Horizon Worlds when entering the trigger\! 💃

``` 
import { CodeBlockEvents, Component, Entity, Player, PropTypes } from 'horizon/core';

class LoopAnimation extends Component\<typeof LoopAnimation\> {

  static propsDefinition \= {

    animation: { type: PropTypes.Asset },

  };

  preStart() {

    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.entity, CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerEnterTrigger, this.OnPlayerEnterTrigger.bind(this));

  }

  start() {

  }

  OnPlayerEnterTrigger(player: Player) {

    player.playAvatarAnimation(this.props.animation\!, {

      looping: true,

      playRate: 1,

      callback: (reason) \=\> {

      }

    });

  }

}

Component.register(LoopAnimation);
```
